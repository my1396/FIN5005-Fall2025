This section covers the essential concepts, formulas, and business examples you’ll use in analytics.\n\n\n\n## Probability Axioms\n\nProbability measures how likely an event is. \n\n$$P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways A can occur}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}}$$\n\n1. $P(A) \\geq 0$ for any event $A$\n2. $P(\\text{all possible outcomes}) = 1$\n3. $P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\text{ and }B)$ \n4. If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then \n   $$\n   P(A \\text{ and } B) = 0\n   $$\n   and\n   $$\n   P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)\n   $$\n   Mutually exclusive means “cannot happen together.”\n\n\n\n::: {.example #exm-1}\nA retailer estimates a 30% chance of a supply chain disruption and a 50% chance of a demand spike. If these events are mutually exclusive, what is the probability of either event occurring?\n:::\n\n<button class=\"solution-btn\" onclick=\"myFunction('sol-1')\">Solution</button>\n<div id=\"sol-1\" class=\"solution-answer env-green\">\nSince the events are mutually exclusive, $P(A \\text{ and } B)=0,$ then\n$$\n\\begin{split}\nP(A \\text{ and } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\text{ and } B)=0.30+0.50=0.80.\n\\end{split}\n$$\n</div>\n\n\n::: {.example #exm-2}\nIn a multi-channel marketing campaign, 35% of customers click an email offer (Event A) and 25% engage with a social media ad (Event B). Data shows 10% of customers do both. What is the probability a randomly selected customer engages with at least one of the two channels (email OR social)?\n:::\n\n<button class=\"solution-btn\" onclick=\"myFunction('sol-2')\">Solution</button>\n<div id=\"sol-2\" class=\"solution-answer env-green\">$P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B) = 0.35 + 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.50$</div>\n\n## Sample vs. Population: Estimating the Big Picture\n\nIn business, we use samples to estimate population characteristics.\n\nSample mean: \n\n$$\n\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\n$$\n\n::: {.example #exm-telecom}\nA telecom company surveys a randomly selected sample of 500 customers about service quality.

In finance, we frequently estimate variance from simulated or historical returns by computing the average of squared returns (giving $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$) and subtracting the square of the average return.\n\n  **Sample estimators:**\n\n  - Biased (population style) estimator: \n    $$ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 $$\n  - Unbiased estimator: \n    $$s^2 = \\dfrac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 $$\n  The latter ($s^2$) subtracts 1 from $n$ in the denominator, which is known as a degrees of freedom correction.

They vary from sample to sample.\n\nKey principles:\n\n1. Replace integrals / probability-weighted sums with empirical averages.\n2. Center around the sample mean when the population mean is unknown.\n3. Use $n-1$ (unbiased) denominators for second moments (variance, covariance) when estimating from an i.i.d. sample.\n4.
