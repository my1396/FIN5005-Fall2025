# Seting Up Your Environment

## Cloud Solution

Cloud solution means that you don't need to install anything on your computer. You can run R code directly in your web browser. This is the easiest way to get started without worrying about installation issues. But soon enough, you will realize that the cloud-based solution is limited 

- computational power
- storage space
- customization options
- AI integration is better in local environment
  
  GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI tool that can assist you in writing code, but it requires a local development environment to function optimally.

Nonetheless, here are two popular cloud solutions:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): good support for `.ipynb`.
- [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/): basic emulator for RStudio IDE in the cloud.


## Local Solution

### RStudio Desktop

[RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and executing R code, making it easier to work with R scripts, data analysis, visualization.

To install RStudio Desktop, follow these steps:
